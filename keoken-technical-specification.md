## Introduction

This document defines the transaction types supported by the *Keoken Protocol*.

*Keoken Protocol* is built over any cryptocurrency compatible with the Bitcoin scripting language. Specifically *Keoken* needs for OP_RETURN (`0x6a`) operation code. Right now *Keoken* could be implemented, over Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC), but it is not limited to them. The cryptocurrency where Keoken is implemented is called *Transport Currency* or *Transport Coin* (from here on we can call it only *Transport*).

## Keoken Transportation

Keoken needs to be transported on an existing cryptocurrency with Bitcoin compatible scripting language that supports the OP_RETURN (0x6a) operation code.

The transportation protocol is defined in the following way:

![Keoken Transportation Protocol](assets/images/keoken_transportation_protocol.svg)

- The first 6 bytes are fixed and always the same. hex: `6a0400004b50`.
- The next byte or bytes represent the size of the _Keoken_ data part, and it's encoded in the following way:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>First Byte</th>
    <th>Extra Bytes</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dec: 04 to 75<br/>hex: 04 to 4b</td>
    <td><center>-</center></td>
    <td>There are no extra bytes. The size of the data part is represented by the value of the first byte.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dec: 76<br/>hex: 4c<br/>OP_PUSHDATA1</td>
    <td><center>1</center></td>
    <td>There is one (1) extra byte after the first byte. The size of the data part is represented by the value of that extra byte.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dec: 77<br/>hex: 4d<br/>OP_PUSHDATA2</td>
    <td><center>2</center></td>
    <td>There are two (2) extra bytes after the first byte. The size of the data part is represented by the value of those extra bytes in little endian order.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dec: 78<br/>hex: 4e<br/>OP_PUSHDATA4</td>
    <td><center>4</center></td>
    <td>There are four (4) extra bytes after the first byte. The size of the data part is represented by the value of those extra bytes in little endian order.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  So the data size could be represented using 1, 2, 3 or 5 bytes.

- After the _data size_, `N` more bytes must follow, where `N` is equal to the value of the _data size_ part. Those N bytes represent the _Keoken Transaction Data_, that is independent of the transport protocol and will be described below.

## Keoken Transactions

Keoken Transactions are valid transactions of the _Transport Coin_, so it must follow the same rules as the _Transport Coin_ plus new rules added by the _Keoken Protocol_.  
There are several **types** of _Keoken Transactions_ (and new types may be created in the future), each type has its own set of rules and there are a set of general rules that has to be followed by all the _Keoken_ transaction types.


A valid _Transport coin transaction_ will be considered a valid _Keoken transaction_ if it complies with the following general rules:

1. There is at least one output that complies with the format described above in the _Keoken Transportation_ section.

The _Keoken Protocol_ always uses the first _Keoken-Transportation-Compliant_ output found.  
Succeeding _Keoken-Transportation-Compliant_ outputs will be ignored by _Keoken_. 

The other outputs whose scripts contain an `OP_RETURN` opcode but do not comply with the _Keoken-Transportation_ rules will be ignored by Keoken, although could be valid outputs in the _Transport Coin_.


## Transaction Types 

* [Create Asset](#create-asset) 
* [Send Tokens](#send-tokens)

## Transactions Format

Keoken transactions have the following common header:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Field Name</th>
    <th>Data Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Version</td>
    <td>16-bit unsigned integer, big-endian format.</td>
    <td>Keoken protocol version. Right now it is 0 (zero) for all the transaction types. Future revisions of this specification may change it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>16-bit unsigned integer, big-endian format.</td>
    <td>Integer representing the transaction type.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Specific Data</td>
    <td>N bytes.</td>
    <td>Dynamic data, specific to the transaction type.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Transactions that fail to follow this format will be ignored by the Keoken protocol.

## Transaction Types Specification

### **Create Asset**

This transaction is used to create new assets. 

Format:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Field Name</th>
    <th>Data Type</th>
    <th>Data Range</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Version</td>
    <td>16-bit unsigned integer, big-endian format.</td>
    <td>Fixed value: 0x00</td>
    <td>Keoken protocol version.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>16-bit unsigned integer, big-endian format.</td>
    <td>Fixed value: 0x00 </td>
    <td>Transaction type: create asset.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Null-terminated ASCII string.</td>
    <td>Min string size: 2 bytes, 1 real char plus the null char (\0).
Max string size: 33 bytes, 32 real chars plus the null char (\0).</td>
    <td>Name of the asset.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Amount</td>
    <td>64-bit two's complement signed integer, big-endian format.</td>
    <td>Greater than 0 (zero).</td>
    <td>Initial amount of tokens.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


If the value of the fields are out of the specified ranges or the transaction doesn’t comply the validations detailed below, the transaction will be considered an *Invalid Keoken Transaction*, even if it is a valid transaction in the *Transport Coin*. Therefore it will not be executed by the Keoken Interpreter.

Every asset has a unique ID generated by Keoken. The first available Keoken asset ID starts in 1 (one) and increments in one for every new asset.

Here is a list of specific rules and validations for the **create asset** transaction type:


1. The address related to the first input will be the asset’s owner. If the first input has no related address, the transaction will be considered an *Invalid Keoken Transaction*.
The rest of the inputs will be ignored by the Keoken protocol, although could be valid inputs in the _Transport Coin_.

2. Asset Name must be non empty and null-terminated ASCII encoded string, with a max size of 32 bytes + 1 byte for the null character.

3. Amount must be greater than 0 (Zero).

### **Send Tokens**

This transaction is used to send tokens from a **source** *Transport coin address* to a **target** *Transport Coin address*.

Format:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Field Name</th>
    <th>Data Type</th>
    <th>Data Range</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Version</td>
    <td>16-bit unsigned integer, big-endian format.</td>
    <td>Fixed value: 0x00</td>
    <td>Keoken protocol version.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>16-bit unsigned integer, big-endian format.</td>
    <td>Fixed value: 0x01</td>
    <td>Transaction type: send tokens.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AssetId</td>
    <td>32-bit unsigned integer, big-endian format.</td>
    <td>Greater or equal than 1 (one)</td>
    <td>Id of the asset. It has to be created using "Create Asset" transaction.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Amount</td>
    <td>64-bit two's complement signed integer, big-endian format.</td>
    <td>Greater than 0 (zero).</td>
    <td>Amount of tokens to transfer.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Here is a list of specific rules and validations for the **send tokens** transaction type:

1. The address related with the first input will be considered as the _source address_. If the first input has no related address, the transaction will be considered an *Invalid Keoken Transaction*. The rest of the inputs will be ignored by the Keoken protocol, although could be valid inputs in the _Transport Coin_.

2. The first output with a different related _address_ than the _source address_ will be considered the _target address_ of the _Keoken_ transaction. If such an address does not exist, the transaction will be considered an *Invalid Keoken Transaction*. The rest of the outputs will be ignored by the Keoken protocol, although could be valid outputs in the _Transport Coin_.

3. The _Asset ID_ must exist. (It had to have been created with the _Create Asset_ transaction).

4. Amount must be greater than 0 (Zero).

5. Amount must be less than or equal to the tokens available to the _source address_ account.

## Examples

### Create Asset

Create a new Keoken Asset called: **Bitprim** with **1'000'000** Tokens.

The owner of the asset will be the wallet **mgt5VsxNUroj9M2uQaTEwbc5am5LMh8F6v**.

Create a transaction using the owner wallet as the first input. An output must be the OP_RETURN script with the Keoken message. All the satoshis coins minus the miner fee can be sent to any wallet in another output.

The UTXO data is:

* output-point: aa699dc5ddf598a50dc2cb2cb2729629cb9d2d865df38e4367d13f81ef55f96e:0
